Johan Liebert (ヨハン・リーベルト, Yohan Rīberuto?) is the titular "monster" and main antagonist of the series. He is the older twin brother of Nina Fortner (formerly known as Anna Liebert) who was shot in the head in 1986, but he was operated on and saved from death by Dr. Kenzo Tenma. Because of this, he is very grateful to Dr. Tenma and extends a profound respect towards his savior throughout the series.

<p>On the surface, Johan is a well-mannered, charismatic, and compassionate yet somewhat aloof young man who possesses a myriad of favorable traits and can easily overwhelm individuals with his seemingly flawless nature, as seen with Hans Georg Schuwald, who describes him as being not of this world. This meticulously crafted facade makes it easy for him to make new allies and manipulate them into doing various deeds for him through the influence of his supposed friendship and good will. With such skill in creating this sense of perfection and pureness, Johan hides his true motives with ease.
Within this contrived exterior, however, Johan callously delivers destruction and suffering to those who happen to fall prey to his schemes. Even before his tenure at Kinderheim 511, Johan still exhibits psychopathic tendencies. For example, most of his murders, both in childhood and adulthood, have been premeditated and calculated.</p>
